# Contributing

This repository is a ledger of predictions faced by measurements, kept small on
purpose. A contribution is welcome when it adds a row to that ledger or corrects
one; the shape of the work is fixed, and this page says what it is.

## What a contribution is

- **A run.** The unit of contribution here is one run on one card: a runsheet
  with its predictions written *before* the card is rented, the raw results
  after, two fitted coefficients, and one row per prediction in a §9 table. The
  whole procedure, and why runs are what accumulate here:
  [docs/adding-a-run.md](docs/adding-a-run.md).
- **A corrected number, with the evidence that corrects it.** Measurement
  outranks derivation ([docs/SLO.md §9](docs/SLO.md#9-assumptions-and-how-they-get-validated)):
  a derivation a run has shown wrong is corrected in place, the §9 table gains
  the row that showed it, and nothing is quietly re-fitted.
- **A documentation fix.** A dangling link, a stale state cell in the README's
  layout table, a term used without an entry in
  [docs/GLOSSARY.md](docs/GLOSSARY.md).

## What it is not

- **Another model.** The served model is one string in three places and six
  derived numbers, and the repository argues against making it a parameter:
  [docs/audience.md](docs/audience.md#changing-the-model). The value here comes
  from comparing configurations of one model, not two models in the same class.
- **A card without a run.** A new `Accelerator(...)` with spec-sheet coefficients
  is welcome as a *prior* — `provenance="prior, unvalidated; no run on this card"`
  — and it will be labelled as one on every page it prints. It becomes a
  measured card only through a run.
- **A stub that fabricates a histogram.** The `kind` stub exports two gauges and
  nothing else, so that eleven dark dashboard panels stay dark rather than lit
  by numbers that mean nothing.
- **A number produced on `kind` quoted as a measurement.** Anywhere.

## What CI enforces

`.github/workflows/bench.yml`, on every push, installing nothing:

- `bench/` is Python 3.10+ standard library only — the tests run on 3.10 and
  3.14 with no `pip install`, and a dependency that became necessary is what
  the workflow fails on;
- the committed front-page chart is what its data produces;
- the committed `site/data/` is what `bench/export_site_data.py` produces, and
  `site/calc.js` agrees with Python on every golden row;
- every node of `docs/symptom-map.json` is a line of `docs/symptom-map.md`, and
  every link in either resolves.

## What a reviewer enforces

The conventions in `CLAUDE.md`, in short: one home per fact, and other files
link to it; SI base units in derivations; dense FLOPS rows, never the sparsity
row; architecture from `config.json`; a derived floor never reported as a
measurement; repository content in English.

And one rule about the evidence rather than the prose: **no file carries a
credential.** Raw logs are captured terminal, so a key can arrive in a pull
request without anyone typing it. `.githooks/no-secrets.sh` refuses the commit,
runs again on a push over every object being sent, and runs in CI on a branch
no hook ever saw; `bench/tests/test_no_secrets.py` is what keeps its patterns
from going quietly inert.

## How to send it

1. **The runsheet first, as its own pull request, before the run.** In the
   public repository the merge date is the dateline, and a sheet merged before
   its results exist is a stronger before-the-fact claim than any sentence in
   the report. The MI300X sheet in `docs/benchmarks/runsheets/` is the
   template.
2. **The results and the report as a second pull request**, with the raw
   evidence under `docs/benchmarks/raw/`, the §9 rows, the coefficient fit, the
   registry edit, and the regenerated chart and site data (`.githooks/pre-commit`
   does both if enabled).
