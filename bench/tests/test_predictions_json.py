"""What --what-if promises the page: a dict whose shape and figures do not move.

Since 2026-09-13 `bench/predictions.py --what-if` is a printer over
`what_if_point()`, and the calculator on the Pages site is a JavaScript port
checked against rows of that same function (`site/data/golden.json`). Two
things can therefore break silently: a key renamed here becomes `undefined` in
the browser, which is a blank cell and not an error; and a change to the text
printer could drift from the dict it claims to render. This file holds both,
plus the nine lines docs/audience.md quotes to the reader, byte for byte.

No dependency on pytest, which is not installed here -- plain functions, plain
asserts, and a runner at the bottom:

# Two ways in, and both have to work. `pytest bench/` gets bench/ on the import
# path from tests/conftest.py; `python3 bench/tests/test_roofline.py` on a rented
# pod, where pytest is not installed, gets only this directory. The three lines
# below are what make the second one work, and they are here rather than in
