"""The front page quotes numbers it does not own; this is what stops them drifting.

`README.md` is a shop window, so it restates figures whose home is `bench/` and
`docs/SLO.md` -- twelve of them. The repository otherwise forbids that (one fact,
one file), and the page under `site/` is exempt only because three guards hold it
equal to the Python. The README had no guard at all: CI ran its *commands* and
asserted none of its *numbers*.

The obvious check is the wrong one, for the reason its sibling
`test_plot_predicted_vs_measured.py` documents: a bare "12" or "0.39" is a
substring of half the file. Every probe below therefore carries prose either side
of the number, is built by f-string from the Python that owns it, and declares
**how many times** it must occur -- because 12, 32 and 64 each appear in more
than one sentence, and editing either copy has to fail.

What this cannot catch, and nothing here pretends otherwise: a number that is
right inside a sentence that is wrong about it. On 2026-09-16 the front page said
run 3's seat count "came out 56 % low" where `docs/SLO.md` section 9 says 56 %
*higher*; the number was correct and only a human reading caught the direction.
"""

# Two ways in, and both have to work. `pytest bench/` gets bench/ on the import
# path from tests/conftest.py; `python3 bench/tests/test_readme_numbers.py` on a
# rented pod, where pytest is not installed, gets only this directory. The three
# lines below are what make the second one work, and they are here rather than in
# conftest.py for exactly that reason.
