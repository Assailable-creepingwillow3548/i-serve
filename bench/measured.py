"""Predicted vs measured, scored against a real run -- roofline.py TODO 6.

Reads the raw results of one `vllm bench serve` sweep and prints what the model
predicted beside what the card did. SLO.md section 9 sets the format and the
reason for it: every row names the coefficient that produced its prediction,
whether that coefficient was itself fitted to this same measurement, and the
accelerator. Drop any of the three and the table quietly compares a prediction
against its own fit, which always agrees.

Separate from predictions.py for the same reason predictions.py is separate from
roofline.py: this file changes when a run happens, that one when an interesting
operating point moves, and roofline.py only when the physics does.

The argument is docs/benchmarks/l40s-baseline.md; this file is the arithmetic
behind it, so a figure quoted there fails here rather than drifting silently.
