"""Run 3 scored: prefix caching, priced in seats -- SLO.md section 9.

Third sibling of measured.py (run 1) and measured_run2.py (run 2), and the same
rule holds: one module per run, because the run is the unit a coefficient belongs
to and merging two of them is how a fitted number starts scoring itself.

What is different here is the evidence, not the argument. Runs 1 and 2 were
transcribed by hand off `vllm bench serve` output into a levels.tsv; run 3 was
driven by bench/harness.py, which writes one JSON file per level. So this module
reads the artefacts directly and there is nothing between the card and the table
below to mistype -- which also means a level's `harness_*` fields, including the
gates it fired, are available here rather than only in a console log.

The predictions this scores were written in
docs/benchmarks/runsheets/l40s-run-3.md before the card was rented, and every coefficient used to make them (eff_mem 0.83,
mfu 0.439, I(n) = 1.640 n - 6.36) comes from run 1. None was fitted to anything
below.

The argument is docs/benchmarks/l40s-run3.md; this file is the arithmetic behind
it, so a figure quoted there fails here rather than drifting silently.
