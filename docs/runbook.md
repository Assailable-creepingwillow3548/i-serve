# Runbook

Operational procedures. Each one is written to be followed at 03:00 by someone who
did not build the stack, which is the only test of a runbook that matters. The
objects every procedure names are the ones under `deploy/`; the numbers it quotes
are derived in [SLO.md](SLO.md) and are not restated here.

## SLO breach — from an alert to a branch

Two rules read the TTFT objective (`deploy/observability/prometheus/rules.yml`;
which SLI, window and burn rate: [SLO.md](SLO.md) §4). The alert that fired says
which branch this is:

- **`QueueBeyondTTFTBudget` naming a `vllm-canary-…` Pod.** A canary that cannot
  hold its share. Go to *Roll back*, below. Nothing else is wrong.
- **`QueueBeyondTTFTBudget` naming a stable Pod.** A queue the autoscaler did not
  clear. Read the replica count against `maxReplicaCount` first: at the cap this
  is capacity — a pool with no accelerator to land on — and below it the scaler
  itself is the fault. Either way the gap is the *queue* term of §4, and the
  answer is replicas, not configuration.
- **`TTFTBudgetBurning` with `waiting` at zero.** Requests are admitted at once
  and still miss the budget: the gap is the *floor* term of §4, and only a
  configuration or hardware change moves it. The decision tree from here is
  [symptom-map.md](symptom-map.md), *TTFT p99 breaching* — it opens with the
  number to read first, the gap above the floor.

## Canary rollout of a model version

The version is whatever changes the two numbers of [SLO.md](SLO.md) §3 — seats in
the KV pool and the decode step: an image tag, a `--model` id, a flag set. On
`kind` it is the two env values in
`deploy/manifests/overlays/kind-canary/patch-version.yaml`, and the whole
procedure was run there once (`deploy/manifests/README.md`, "Canary, observed on
kind"). The split is by weight at the edge, not by replica count: the canary is a
second Deployment with its own Service behind an Ingress ingress-nginx treats as
a weighted alternative for the same `/v1` rule
(`deploy/manifests/overlays/kind-canary/`).

**Before traffic.**

1. **Capacity.** The canary Pod needs an accelerator the stable track is not
   using. On a fixed pool that means lowering the stable `maxReplicaCount` by one
   for the duration, or the canary sits `Pending` and the rollout tests nothing.
   On `kind` there is nothing to reserve.
2. **Write the version** into `patch-version.yaml` and nothing else in that
   directory. The weight stays at 10.
3. **Apply and wait:**

        kubectl apply -k deploy/manifests/overlays/kind-canary
        kubectl -n llm rollout status deployment/vllm-canary

4. **Read the startup log before reading any latency.** vLLM logs the KV cache
   size and block count it actually got; the stub prints its seats and step. Put
   that number against what §3's arithmetic predicts for this version. A seat
   count that is not the predicted one is a roll-back *now*, with no traffic
   spent — the version is not what it was thought to be.
5. **Confirm it is scraped.** A target with `service="vllm-canary"` must be `up`
   in Prometheus, or the canary will queue in silence and the signal below never
   arrives.

**The signal.** `QueueBeyondTTFTBudget` naming a `vllm-canary-…` Pod. It is the
one rule that exists on `kind`, and on a card it is the faster of the two: a
canary that queues has already missed the budget for every request in that queue.
Watch it for at least the rule's `for` window plus the time a queue takes to form
at the canary's share of the arrival rate — 2.5 min on `kind` at one request per
second; on a card, the burn-rate windows of §4 set the floor at one hour.

**Decide.**

- **Fired, and the Pod is the canary's → Roll back.** Prefer to do it at
  `pending`: the cost of a roll-back is the queue standing on the canary, and
  the queue is deeper at `firing`.
- **Nothing fired after the window → Promote.** In this order, because the
  stable rollout is `strategy: Recreate` and is a gap:
  1. Set the canary weight to 100 — the canary now carries everything on its
     one replica, which is degraded capacity and not downtime.
  2. Write the version into the stable overlay and apply it; wait for
     `rollout status deployment/vllm`. The gap is the old Pod's drain plus the
     new Pod's weight load — 69 s cold on the L40S ([benchmarks/l40s-run3.md](benchmarks/l40s-run3.md) §6) — and the canary is the only replica serving through it.
  3. `kubectl delete -k deploy/manifests/overlays/kind-canary`. The rule
     reverts to the stable backend; the canary's in-flight requests finish
     inside its drain.

  Not yet run; the capacity arithmetic above is derived, not measured.

## Roll back

One command, and it is the same command whether the canary is healthy or not:

    kubectl delete -k deploy/manifests/overlays/kind-canary

What follows, measured once on `kind`: the edge reverts to the stable backend
within seconds — requests drawn for the canary in that window fall through to
stable and succeed; the alert clears when the canary Service leaves discovery,
about half a minute in; the Pod itself takes the readiness withdrawal plus the
drain to exit and **every request still in its queue at that point fails.** A
roll-back does not rescue the requests the canary already holds; it stops it
taking more. That is the argument for rolling back at `pending`.

Rolling back a version that was already *promoted* is a stable rollout in the
other direction — the previous version written back into the stable overlay and
applied — and pays the same `Recreate` gap the promotion did, with no canary to
carry traffic through it unless one is applied first.

## Morning triage — five minutes on one dashboard

The dashboard is `vLLM — SLO` (`deploy/observability/grafana/`; reaching it is
one port-forward, in the repository `README.md`). It is read **top to bottom and
never bottom up**, because its three rows are ordered by the question they
answer, and the last row is only a question when the first row says so. Read it
once with the *Track* variable at *All*; if anything is red, once more per track
— a canary and a stable fleet share a dashboard and must not share a diagnosis.

**On `kind` the order inverts, and this is its one exception.** The stub exports
two gauges and no histogram, so row 1's shares and row 2 are *No data* by
construction (`deploy/observability/README.md`). Row 3's entry condition — *read
only when row 1 is not healthy* — therefore cannot be established from the
numbers: only the alert table can still trip it, so with no alert firing a reader
who follows the order above walks away thinking the stack is fine when nothing
about the promise has been measured at all. On `kind`, read **row 3 first** — queue per
replica, seats, replicas scraped — and then row 1's **alert table**, which does
work, because the queue rule stands on a gauge the stub genuinely serves. Five
panels of sixteen light here; that is the fixture, not the procedure. On a card
the order above is the right one.

**Row 1 — is the promise kept.** Two shares, a burn rate and the alert table.
*Healthy:* TTFT and TPOT shares at or above 99 %, burn rate under 1 on the hour,
the table empty. Anything in the table ends triage: go to *SLO breach*, above.
A burn rate between 1 and 14.4 with no alert is budget being spent faster than
it is earned and not yet a page — write it down and let the hour window say by
lunch whether it was a blip. Two things this row cannot say: the TTFT share is
stricter than the SLO by 50 ms, so a share of 98.5 % is not yet a proven
breach of the 300 ms target ([SLO.md](SLO.md) §4); and on `kind` the shares are
*No data* by construction (`deploy/observability/README.md`).

**Row 2 — what the users get, and its price.** Goodput first, tokens per second
last, and the order is the point: a server can look busy while every user is
outside their latency target. *Healthy:* a thin goodput band that tracks the
*completed* line. The band opening — upper far above lower — is the two SLIs
failing on *different* requests, which no server-side number can resolve and
the client-side `--goodput` can; *completed* running well above the band is the
service busy and failing. On `$/1M`, the SLO-respecting line is the figure to
report and the other is a diagnostic; the two diverging is [SLO.md](SLO.md) §7's
first reading happening live. A fall in `h` with nothing deployed is the traffic
changing, not the stack — the same seats serve fewer users at a lower hit rate.

**Row 3 — where the gap is.** Read only when row 1 is not healthy; it decomposes
a breach into the two terms of [SLO.md](SLO.md) §4.

- *Queue on any replica* — the queue term. Replicas scraped at
  `maxReplicaCount`: capacity, a pool with no accelerator to land on. Below it:
  the scaler, or a Pod that never joined — *targets down* names it, and its
  startup log is read before anything else.
- *Queue at zero, seats below the ceiling, KV usage well under 0.9, row 1 red*
  — the floor term. Only a configuration or hardware change moves it; the
  decision tree is [symptom-map.md](symptom-map.md) — *TTFT p99 breaching* if
  row 1's red share is TTFT, *TPOT p99 breaching* if it is TPOT, and each opens
  with the number to read first.
- *KV usage near 1.0 with preemptions* — the pool, not the queue: the engine
  admitted more than it could hold ([SLO.md](SLO.md) §6). The OOM procedure
  below is the continuation, when written.
- *Seats flat at the ceiling with a queue beside them* — the seat count is
  binding; whether that is capacity or the latency limit is a property of the
  card ([SLO.md](SLO.md) §6), and the answer is in the startup log's pool size,
  not on this dashboard.

What was seen when this was run on `kind`, with the breach the alerting rules
were tested on: `deploy/observability/README.md`, "Observed on kind,
2026-09-07".

## Not yet written

**OOM.** What vLLM does when the KV cache cannot admit a sequence, why
`gpu_memory_utilization` is not the lever it appears to be ([SLO.md](SLO.md) §6),
and what to check first — the KV cache size vLLM logs at startup. Waits on a
card. The branch exists — [symptom-map.md](symptom-map.md), *OOM / preemptions
climbing* — the procedure does not.
